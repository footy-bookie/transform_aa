This microservice is run a GCP Cloud Engine VM. The VM is triggered every Thursday by a Pub/Sub event and saves the results in Bigquery Table.

I am applying the Archetype Analysis(AA) as part of the feature engineering.
The AA is a way of dimensionality reduction to point out in a dataset, a certain number of archetypes. 
Classical archetypes to be expected are high performing clubs like Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. 
But also, medium and low preforming clubs can create archetypes in certain combinations of data, which can help to describe similarly performing teams.

The original code can be found: https://www.miller-blog.com/archetypal-analysis/
I adapted it a little bit, to better suite my usecase.
